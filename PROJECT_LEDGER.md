# Ledger Project Ledger

Shared coordination file for Shaun, ChatGPT, Claude Chat and Claude Code.
Last updated: 2026-09-21 (against `main` @ `1f6cd15` + theme work)

---

## Current State

Ledger is a **single-file PWA**: the entire app (HTML, CSS, JS) lives in
`index.html` (~8,000 lines, no build step, no framework, ES5-style vanilla JS).
Supporting files: `sw.js`, `manifest.json`, `fonts/` (self-hosted Playfair
Display + Inter woff2 subsets), `hero-mountain.webp`, icons, `avatars/`,
and `functions/` (one Firebase Cloud Function).

**Five tabs:** Plan · Today · Calendar · Progress · Focus.

### Today (the main surface)
- **Morning Prime** — a 4-step daily setup: plan meals → three key tasks →
  finish Today's Plan → set intention. Collapses to a single "Completed at
  HH:MM" row once done. Stored as `plan.morningPrime` on the day's plan record.
- **Actions** — collapsible section with two independent views:
  - **Order view**: one numbered execution sequence for the day, drag to reorder.
  - **Groups view**: collapsible category sections, each with its own internal order.
  - Orders stored separately as `plan.actionOrder` and `plan.groupOrder[category]`.
  - Reordering is pointer-event based (HTML5 drag-and-drop does not work on touch).
- **Key tasks** — Morning Prime's three; normal actions flagged `isKeyTask`,
  marked in both views with a gold star, gold left edge and a `Key` pill.
- **Add action** — compact disclosure holding Quick add and Detailed add.
- **Backlog** — unfinished actions from past dates; bounded 3-row preview on
  Today plus a full sheet (sort by Group/Date, filter, Add to today, Pick a day).
- **Today's Plan** — 2×2 card grid (Training / Meals / Roadblock / Diet),
  with a share control for Daily Handoff.
- **Quick Log** — collapsible grid: Nutrition, Weight, Daily photo, Padel,
  Cardio, Resistance, Mobility, Symptoms.
- **Recorded Activity** — collapsible, with a summary in its header.
- **Catch-up** — closes a past day against its real records (actions tally,
  logged training, nutrition state, overall status, notes).
- **Daily Handoff** — "Share day" → structured text export for Claude, with an
  optional instruction footer; clipboard + Web Share API.

### Other tabs
- **Plan** — 7-day week list with per-day summaries; meal ideas library.
- **Calendar** — month grid, day detail, day status.
- **Progress** (`view-stats`) — weekly bar chart, health & training stat cards,
  stat detail sheets.
- **Focus** — player card (XP/level/tier/streak/avatar), priorities, target
  weight, focus items.

### Nutrition
Daily checks (gluten-free, minimal processed, water, water amount, suspected
gluten exposure), food diary, day rating, calories. Lifecycle: **In progress**
vs **Day logged/Closed**. Exposure records source/time/confidence/note only;
**symptom episodes are a separate dated session type** (`type: 'symptom'`) with
their own onset date/time and an optional *possible* link to an exposure.

### Training
Planned training lives in `plan.trainingDetails[type]`; logging opens the same
activity form pre-filled and creates a real session linked via `sessionId`.

### Gamification / XP
Focus tab shows a player card: XP → level → tier (Rookie, Grinder, Contender,
Competitor, Veteran, Elite) with per-tier avatar art and a day streak.
`computeXP()` is currently `sessions.length × 10 + completed focus items × 25`.

### Notifications / Pin Now
Web Push. Client writes to `ledger_pins`; `functions/index.js` (Firebase Cloud
Function, `onDocumentCreated`) sends the push via `web-push`. VAPID private key
lives in Secret Manager, never in the repo. Device subscriptions in
`ledger_push_subscriptions`.

### Theming
Three modes — **Dark** (default and primary identity), **Light** (warm parchment
editorial), **System** (follows `prefers-color-scheme`, live). Resolved theme
sits on `<html data-theme>`; every component reads semantic tokens only. An
inline pre-render bootstrap in `<head>` applies the stored choice before first
paint. Preference in `localStorage` under `ledger_theme`. Control lives in
Focus → Appearance. `<meta name="theme-color">` updates with the theme.

### Persistence
Firebase Firestore (project `ledger-6aec3`) with a **full localStorage
fallback** — the app works entirely offline/unconfigured. Collections:
`ledger_commitments`, `ledger_plans`, `ledger_sessions`, `ledger_day_status`,
`ledger_priorities`, `ledger_focus`, `ledger_meals`, `ledger_meta`,
`ledger_pins`, `ledger_push_subscriptions`. Live `onSnapshot` listeners drive
re-renders. Deployed to GitHub Pages (`https://sgj-92.github.io/Ledger/`).

## Product Vision

Ledger is a private personal operating system for Shaun.

Its core loop is:

Plan → Do → Track → Review → Adjust

The app should:
- give clarity and structure
- connect longer-term direction to daily action
- support whole-life planning without showing everything all the time
- make progress visual and motivating
- provide honest, evidence-based accountability
- adapt when work, family or life disrupts plans
- remain simple, fast and phone-first
- recommend; Shaun decides
- keep goals, priorities and circumstances editable rather than hardcoded

---

## Product Principles

- Today before history
- Direction before productivity
- Evidence before encouragement
- Missing data is not failure
- Minimum viable wins when life is disrupted
- Whole-life understanding without daily overload
- Ledger recommends; Shaun decides
- Privacy by design
- Earned and explainable gamification
- Editable goals rather than hardcoded assumptions
- Start small and let the system grow through real use

---

## Agreed Architecture

Conventions that should not be casually changed.

- Today actions use the same action records across views.
- Order view stores a global daily execution order.
- Groups view stores a separate within-group order.
- Switching Order/Groups must not destroy the other order.
- Category/group changes move a task between groups without duplicating it.
- Morning Prime uses existing Ledger actions and plan data rather than
  duplicate task/meal systems.
- Morning Prime key tasks are normal actions with a key-task marker.
- Morning Prime and Today's Plan must share the same underlying data.
- Planned activities and recorded activities are distinct but linked.
- Planned activity can pre-fill the actual log.
- Planned meals become nutrition evidence when marked eaten.
- Nutrition can be saved in progress or explicitly closed.
- Recorded Activity should distinguish Nutrition In progress from
  Day logged/Closed.
- Backlog holds unfinished historical actions; items are only moved to
  Today/future dates deliberately.
- Catch-up closes the actual previous-day record rather than creating a
  disconnected copy.
- Catch-up must reflect already-recorded training, actions and nutrition.
- Suspected gluten exposure date/time and symptom onset date/time are separate
  concepts.
- Possible exposure-to-symptom links must remain explicitly suspected, not
  treated as proven causation.
- Daily Handoff exports Ledger day data in a stable structured format for Claude.
- Today is an execution surface, not merely a read-only summary of Plan.
- Same data should use the same editor wherever possible.
- Main branch may be used unless Shaun explicitly requests otherwise.

### Implementation conventions observed in code
- Single-file app: all product code in `index.html`. No build step.
- ES5-style vanilla JS (`var`, function expressions) to match existing code.
- Per-date state lives on the day's plan record (`ledger_plans/<date>`);
  per-device UI preferences live in `localStorage`.
- Order/group hints are **sparse**: unlisted ids sort after listed ones by
  creation order, so new actions land at the bottom with nothing written and
  no migration is needed.
- Forms must build on top of the existing record (`Object.assign`), never
  rebuild it from scratch — doing so has silently destroyed sibling fields
  three separate times (see Decisions Log).

## Decisions Log

### 2026-09-21 — Theme is a device-level setting over semantic tokens
**Decision:** Ledger supports Dark, Light and System. The preference is a
device-level UI setting stored in `localStorage` (`ledger_theme`), never in
Firestore. System follows `prefers-color-scheme` and reacts live; an explicit
Dark or Light ignores the OS. Dark remains the default and the primary visual
identity. All visual components depend on semantic theme tokens rather than
assuming dark.
**Why:** The same product should work in an evening and on a desk in daylight
without becoming a different app — and without a second stylesheet to maintain.
**Implications:** Only tokens change between themes; no component knows which
theme it is in. Light is a deliberate palette (parchment / cream / espresso /
antique gold), not an inversion. The hero photograph is theme-driven via
`--hero-*` tokens — lit at night, a pressed watermark on paper. Colours that
carry meaning (the eight category accents, four day-status colours, six rank
tiers) keep their hue and are adjusted only for legibility. Contrast was
measured, not eyeballed: light finished at 1 flagged item against dark's 97
existing.

### 2026-09-18 — Two independent action orderings
**Decision:** Order view and Groups view maintain separate stored orderings
(`plan.actionOrder`, `plan.groupOrder[category]`); neither is derived from the
other.
**Why:** They answer different questions — "what next?" vs "how is my day
organised?". A single ordering forced one to destroy the other.
**Implications:** Both stored per date on the plan record. Sparse hints mean no
migration and free bottom-append for new actions. Today's Actions no longer
groups by linked priority — Groups view is category-only.

### 2026-09-18 — Key-task standing does not survive a date change
**Decision:** `isKeyTask` is cleared whenever an action is rescheduled.
**Why:** Each day's Morning Prime chooses its own three. A moved task would
otherwise arrive pre-flagged on a day that never selected it, and silently
consume that day's allowance.
**Implications:** Applies to both the Backlog move and the action editor.

### 2026-09-15 — Exposure and symptoms are separate dated records
**Decision:** Suspected gluten exposure stays on the nutrition record for the
day the food was consumed (source, meal/time, confidence, note). Symptoms are a
separate `type: 'symptom'` session with their own onset date/time and an
optional `possibleExposureId`.
**Why:** Symptoms usually appear the following morning. Collapsing both onto one
date would make later pattern analysis dishonest.
**Implications:** Links are stored and worded as *possible*, never causal. Stats
count exposures and symptom episodes separately and report only recorded links.
Catch-up may prompt for symptoms after a previous-day exposure but must never
assume they occurred.

### 2026-09-15 — Catch-up closes the real day record
**Decision:** Catch-up derives every block from that date's own records and
merges its result onto `ledger_day_status/<date>`.
**Why:** It was a disconnected status picker that ignored everything Ledger
already held.
**Implications:** "Open nutrition" opens that date's actual entry preloaded;
training hands over to the real activity form. Only the judgements no record can
infer (overall status, notes) originate in the sheet.

### 2026-09-15 — Daily Handoff is a stable structured export
**Decision:** A fixed section order (date, intention, key tasks, other actions,
today's plan, roadblocks, status) rendered as plain text, with an optional
Claude-instruction footer.
**Why:** Ledger is the source of truth for planning; Claude is the bridge into
external tools. A predictable shape makes it parseable.
**Implications:** No ids or storage fields are emitted. Nothing is invented — an
action with no recorded time has none. Backlog items appear as context only,
explicitly marked as not today's work.

### 2026-09-15 — Morning Prime includes Today's Plan as a step
**Decision:** "Finish Today's Plan" is step 3; completion is recorded as
`plan.planReviewedAt` when the plan sheet is saved.
**Why:** Planning was two disconnected systems. Reviewing and saving the plan is
the honest completion signal — it does not demand every field be filled.
**Implications:** Morning Prime guides the plan rather than restating it, and
cannot complete until the plan step passes.

### 2026-09-13 — Backlog is a recovery layer, never auto-carry-forward
**Decision:** Unfinished past actions surface in a Backlog derived at read time;
nothing moves to an active day unless deliberately pulled there.
**Why:** Backlog is unresolved history; Today is consciously chosen work.
**Implications:** Membership is a filter (past date, not completed, not a
roadblock). `originalDate` preserves when an action was first written down;
`date` is where it is scheduled now.

### 2026-09-12 — Morning Prime reuses existing records
**Decision:** Key tasks are ordinary actions flagged `isKeyTask`; the meals step
is a view over `plan.meals`. No parallel Morning Prime task or meal type.
**Why:** One source of truth; nothing to keep in sync.
**Implications:** Editing meals in Morning Prime immediately changes Today's Plan
and Nutrition sync.

### 2026-09-12 — Forms must preserve the record they edit
**Decision:** Every editor builds on top of the existing record rather than
constructing a fresh object.
**Why:** Rebuilding silently dropped fields the form did not name — this
destroyed `isKeyTask` (action editor) and `morningPrime` (plan sheet) before
being caught.
**Implications:** Treat "rebuild from scratch" as a bug pattern in review.

### 2026-09-11 — Firestore rules left fully open
**Decision:** `allow read, write: if true`, accepted knowingly for a
single-user app with no login.
**Why:** No auth exists; the app must work immediately on Shaun's phone.
**Implications:** Anyone with the project ID could read/write all personal data
or write to `ledger_pins` to push arbitrary notifications. Revisit before any
wider exposure — see Open Questions.

## Current Task

Owner: None
Status: Ready
Objective: No active implementation task. Await next handoff.
Acceptance criteria: N/A

(Theme support completed 2026-09-21; see Decisions Log and Recently Completed.)

## Open Questions

1. **Firestore rules vs "Privacy by design".** Rules are fully open and not in
   the repo (no `firestore.rules`; `firebase.json` deploys functions only).
   Knowingly accepted, but it conflicts with the stated principle. Options
   previously offered: scope rules per collection, App Check, or real auth.
2. **XP is not yet "earned and explainable".** `computeXP()` is
   `sessions.length × 10 + completed focus items × 25` — every session counts
   equally regardless of effort or evidence quality, and nothing in the UI
   explains where XP came from. Conflicts with the gamification principle.
3. **Two overlapping day-review flows.** `openReviewDaySheet` (older,
   per-action status then overall day) still exists and is reachable from the
   header and calendar day detail, alongside the newer `openCatchUpSheet`.
   Decide whether Review day should be retired, merged, or kept for a distinct
   purpose.
4. **Priority grouping was dropped from Today.** Groups view is category-only.
   Priorities remain on the action, in its editor and in the Handoff export.
   Confirm this is the intended end state, or whether priority deserves a
   third view.
5. **Light-mode refinements still open.** The six rank-tier colours are fixed
   values set inline by JS; on parchment the level chip needs a darkening
   overlay to stay legible, and Rookie/Grinder read faintly as ring and XP-bar
   fills. A tier palette that adapts per theme would be cleaner, but the
   colours carry rank meaning so it is a product decision, not a styling one.
6. **No automated tests or CI.** Verification to date has been manual Playwright
   scripting in the working session, none of it committed. Decide whether a
   minimal smoke suite belongs in the repo.
